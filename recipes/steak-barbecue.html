		</p>
		<p>Recipe by Andrea</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>¾ cup vegetable oil</li>
			<li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
			<li>12 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
			<li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
			<li>1 ½ teaspoons ground ginger</li>
			<li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
			<li>1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Whisk vegetable oil, soy sauce, vinegar, honey, garlic powder, ginger,
				and green onion together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag.
				Add flank steak, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal
				the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours.
			</li>
			<li>
				Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the
				grate.
			</li>
			<li>
				Remove flank steak from marinade and shake off excess. Pour marinade
				into a small saucepan and set aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cook flank steak on the preheated grill until firm and reddish-pink and
				juicy in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read
				thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54
				degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove from the grill and cover with several
				sheets of aluminum foil. Let rest for 10 minutes, then slice thinly
				against the grain.
			</li>
			<li>
				While the steak is cooking and resting, bring marinade to a boil over
				medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10
				minutes. Pour over sliced steak to serve.
			</li>
		</ol>
